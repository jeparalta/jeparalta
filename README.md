👋 Hi, I’m @jeparalta and I have recently shifted my focus towards learning web development. After spending the last 15+ years owning and running small businesses, including a surfschool, 2 hostels, a restaurant, and 2 surfshops, I am now excited to learn about the ins and outs of web development.

🌱 My current focus is on learning Python, Django, and Javascript, as these are essential skills for web development. I am dedicated to expanding my knowledge and skills in this area.

👀 When I'm not coding, I enjoy sailing, surfing, and improving my small business. I am always eager to learn about new things and to understand how they work.

💞️ I am looking for opportunities to collaborate on challenging projects where I can bring real value. If you have any ideas or requests, feel free to email me at jeparalta@gmail.com.

Thank you for stopping by and I look forward to connecting with you!
