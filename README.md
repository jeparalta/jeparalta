- 👋 Hi, I’m @jeparalta and I've spent the last 15+ years owning/running small businesses (a surfschool, 2 x hostels, cafés, 2 x surfshops and currently a boutique guesthouse).
- 👀 I’m interested in sailing, surfing, improving on my small business, and just learning about how things tick.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C, Python, Finance and Crypto.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that will challenge me and that I can bring real value to.
- 📫 Email me on jeparalta@gmail.com for random requests/ideas
