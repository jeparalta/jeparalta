Hi, I’m @jeparalta and I have recently shifted my focus towards web development. After spending the last 15+ years owning and running small businesses, including a surfschool, 2 hostels, a restaurant, and 2 surfshops, I am now excited to get deep into the ins and outs of web development.

I am currently working on building a booking management system to help small businesses similar to the ones I've run in the past.

When I'm not writing code, I enjoy sailing, surfing, and improving my small business. I am always eager to learn about new things and to understand how they work.

I am looking for opportunities to collaborate on interesting projects where I can bring real value. If you have any ideas or requests, feel free to email me at jeparalta@gmail.com.
